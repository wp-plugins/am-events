Adds an event post type with an interface and template tags similar to normal posts. Also includes a customizable widget for upcoming events.

== Description ==

The plugin adds a custom event post type with two taxonomies: event category and venue. 

Allows the user to add new events just like normal posts with added fields for start time, end time, category and venue. You can also easily create weekly or biweekly recurring events.

Displaying the events is done in the theme files using WP_Query and the template tags provided by the plugin. This allows full control over the layout and what elements to show.

The plugin also includes a widget for showing upcoming events. It uses a very simple template system for full control of the layout.

The plugin is fully translatable. The only available languages at the moment are english(default), finnish and norwegian. The download includes a .pot-file for additional translations.

For integrating AM Events to an existing theme, I suggest creating a [child theme](http://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes) with custom page templates. You can download a full example of a working Twenty Twelve child theme from my website [(Download link)](http://attemoisio.fi/projects/am-events/twentytwelve-child.zip). It contains three different page templates for events pages.

See Other Notes for detailed information and a small tutorial about the custom post type and the widget.

If you think something critical is missing, feel free to send me a request. I'm using this on some of my client's sites so I'll certainly be improving/fixing it for upcoming Wordpress versions.

== Widget ==

Here are the shortcodes available in the upcoming events widget template.

 * [event-title]
 * [start-date]
 * [end-date]
 * [event-venue]
 * [event-category]
 * [content]
 * [permalink]

The title can be linked to the event post with the 'link' attribute, e.g. [event-title link=true]

The category and venue can also be linked similarly to their respective archive pages using the 'link' attribute, e.g. [event-category link=true]

The number of words displayed in the title or the content can be limited by the 'limit' attribute, e.g. [content limit=25] or [event-title limit=10].

The dates can be formatted using the 'format' attribute, e.g. [start-date format='d.m.Y H:i'] (see [PHP date](http://php.net/manual/en/function.date.php) for formatting options). If no format is given, the default WordPress date format is used.

You can use any shortcode as many times as needed in a single template. To separate date and time of start date for example you could write:
    
    [start-date format='d.m.Y'] 
    <span>divider</span>
    [start-date format='H:i']

= Template tags =

Template tags were introduced in version 1.3.0 and are listed below. More documentation can be found in the source files.

    // Template tags for getting and displaying event dates
    am_the_startdate($format = 'Y-m-d H:i:s', $before = '', $after = '', $echo = true)
    am_get_the_startdate( $format = 'Y-m-d H:i:s', $post = 0 )
    am_the_enddate($format = 'Y-m-d H:i:s', $before = '', $after = '', $echo = true)
    am_get_the_enddate( $format = 'Y-m-d H:i:s', $post = 0 )
    
    // Template tags for getting and displaying event venues
    am_get_the_venue( $id = false )
    am_in_venue( $venue, $post = null )
    am_get_the_venue_list( $separator = '', $parents='', $post_id = false )
    am_the_venue( $separator = '', $parents='', $post_id = false )

    // Template tags for getting and displaying event categories
    am_get_the_event_category( $id = false )
    am_get_the_event_category_list( $separator = '', $parents='', $post_id = false )
    am_in_event_category( $eventCategory, $post = null )
    am_the_event_category( $separator = '', $parents='', $post_id = false )

Example of displaying the first category of the current event post:
    
    $categoryArray = am_get_the_event_category();
    echo $categoryArray[0]->name;

== Creating a WP_Query ==

The custom post type is named 'am_event'
The taxonomies are named 'am_venues' and 'am_event_categories'.

The event post has metadata named 'am_startdate' and 'am_enddate' that are formatted like 'yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm'

So suppose I wanted to display all events with a category of 'other' and venue 'mcdonalds'. I would then make a WP_Query like this:

    $args = array(
            'post_type' => 'am_event',
            'post_status' => 'publish',
            'tax_query' => array(
                    'relation' => 'AND',
                    array(
                        'taxonomy' => 'am_venues',
                        'field' => 'name',
                        'terms' => 'mcdonalds',
                    ),
                    array(
                        'taxonomy' => 'am_event_categories',
                        'field' => 'name',
                        'terms' => 'other'
                    ),
            ),
        );

    $the_query = new WP_Query($args);

    if ($the_query->have_posts()) {
        while ($the_query->have_posts()) {
            $the_query->the_post();

            $postId = $post->ID;

            // Use template tags to get start and end date
            $startDate = am_get_the_startdate('Y-m-d H:i:s');
            $endDate = am_get_the_enddate('Y-m-d H:i:s');

            // Use template tags to get venues and categories in an array
            $venues = am_get_the_venue( $postId );
            $eventCategories = am_get_the_category( $postId );

            // All the other functions used for posts like
            // the_title() and the_content() work just like with normal posts.

            // ...  DISPLAY POST CONTENT HERE ... //

        }
    }


If you want the events ordered by start date, add the following to $args:

    'orderby' => 'meta_value',
    'meta_key' => 'am_startdate',
    'order' => 'ASC',

If you need to display only upcoming events, add the following meta_query argument to $args:

    'meta_query' => array(
            array(
                'key' => 'am_enddate',
                'value' => date('Y-m-d H:i:s', time()),
                'compare' => ">",
                ),
            ),
	),

The plugin folder also contains a file "examples.php", which contains an example function for displaying upcoming events in a table.
